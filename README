Frontend testing Documentation and how to create a test

We use phpunit and selenium webDriver with facebook's php bindings to create functional tests.

We've included everything as a composer dependency so you only need to download composer and run

composer install

in order to fetch the dependencies.


Running tests:

To run the tests you first need to start the remote webdriver server.
For convenience a reasonably recent server executable is included with the project.
You can start the server by running:

java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.45.0.jar

from the tests directory.

This will start a local webdriver server that listens on localhost and port 4444.

Then you execute tests by running:

vedor/bin/phpunit <path_to_your_test>

Writing your own tests:

To write your own tests you can check

<tests_dir>/admin/model/AddUserControllerTest.php for an example

A BaseTest class with some helper functions is provided.

General guilines (from a guy with limited experience on writing tests so suggestions are welcome):

0) Test for normal behavior first
1) Test if it generates all the erros second
3) Identify the edge cases and write tests for them
4) In order to get a unique css path for the element you want to click you can inspect it in firefox or chrome and right-click on the element and select Copy CSS Path
5) Cleanup after your test, tearDown() exists for that reason too.
6) Each class should test one feature. E.g. AddUserTest should test if a user can be added sucessfully.
