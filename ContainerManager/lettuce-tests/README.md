CRUD Docker Lettuce Tests
==========================

Very basic test cases for the following operations have been implemented using lettuce in BDD format and added here.

* Spawning a container
* Listing all active containers
* Killing an container

Since all the tests use lettuce BDD framework, it should be installed before these steps are run

`[sudo] pip install lettuce`

To run the tests just call the lettuce base command from this directory

`username@host ~/Documents/hackademic/ContainerManager/lettuce-tests $ lettuce`
