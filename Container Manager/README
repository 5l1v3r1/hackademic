Container Manager
=================

Installation:
-------------

Run the `install.py`script. It will automatically install (if not installed already) and configure Ubuntu base image with the challenges inside the Web_Challenges directory.

Note:
-----

1) You might want to have some patience since if you are running it for the first time, it will be downloading around 350 MB. From the 2nd time, downloading will not be required.

2) If there is any error, please start a new [issue](https://github.com/a0xnirudh/hackademic/issues) with the error that you got from log files located inside the directory `hackademic-logs`.

3) Check for a new build called `hackademic` after the installation. Use the command `docker images` in a terminal and verify there is a new build.

4) If you wanna test out the challenge (A simple phpinfo() as of now) run the command `docker run -d -p 1337:80 hackademic` and after this go to the URL `ip-address:1337/testchallenge1` and see if you are getting the output of phpinfo().
